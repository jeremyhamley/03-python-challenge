# Python-Challenge

The Python Challenge repository contains 4 Python coding challenges that are listed below.  
The script for each challenge (along with any resource files) is stored in a seperate directory within each repository.



# PyBank Challenge
This Python script is used for analyzing simple financial records.  
The finacial records are stored in a csv file - this file lists the total profit(or loss) for each month.

This Python script will calculate the following data:

 - The total number of months listed within the csv file
 - The net total amount of profit(or loss) over the entire period
 - The average change in profit(or loss) from month to month
 - The month with the greatest increase in profits
 - The month with the greatest decrease in profits

This scrpit will record the analysis of the finacial data in a txt file and save it in the Anaysis directory within the PyBank directory.

This script will also print the finacial anaysis in the terminal.



# PyPoll Challenge
This Python script is used for collection Election results and calculating the winner of the election.  
The election data is stored in a csv file and contains the follwoing data for each vote cast:  the voter id, the county the vost was cast in, and the candiate that was voted for.

This Python script was written for an election with four candidates and will calculate the following data:

 - The total number of votes cast
 - The list of candidates
 - The total number of votes cast for each candidate
 - The percentage of the overall vote that each candidate earned
 - The winner of the election

This scrpit will record the election data in a txt file and save it in the Anaysis directory with the PyPoll directory.

This script will also print the election results in the terminal.



# PyBoss Challenge
This Python script is used to convert the format of employee data stored in a csv file.  
The employee data will be imported, reformatted, reorganized, and then saved in a new csv file.

This Python script was written to convert the follwing "OLD" employee data to the "NEW" employee data:

 - Example of the imported "OLD" employee data:

    Emp ID,      Name,       DOB,         SSN,       State
    214,    Sarah Simpson, 1985-12-04, 282-01-8166,  Florida

 - Example of the exported "NEW" employee data:

    Emp ID, First Name, Last Name,    DOB,         SSN,    State
    214,      Sarah,     Simpson,  12/04/1985, ***-**-8166,  FL

This scrpit will record the "NEW" employee data in a csv file named new_employee_data.csv and save it in the the PyBoss directory.



# PyParagraph Challenge
This Python script is used to analyze the complexity of a writing sample.  This script is written to open and analyze 2 different writting samples.   

The Python script will open the writting passages stored in a txt file and calculate the follwoing data: 

 - The approximate number of words in each of the writting samples
 - The approximate number of sentences in each of the writting samples
 - The average number of letters in each word
 - The average number of words in each sentence

This scrpit will record the writting analysys data in a txt file and save it in the Anaysis directory with the PyParagraph directory.

This script will also print the writting analysys data in the terminal.
